		<h1>Welcome! I'm Genna</h1>

		<p>Hello! I'm a full stack software developer &#128187;, 
			currently attending the full-time web-development course at Le Wagon in Montr√©al. 
			I have a degree in Supply Chain Management &#128200; 
			and I love learning something new every day! In my spare time I enjoy playing video games &#127918;.</p></br>

			<h2>Supply Chain</h2>
			<p>My background in business has given me great insight into the inner workings of what it takes for a company to succeed; 
				I can't wait to apply that knowledge to the products I will build as a software developer.

			<h2>My Bootcamp Experience So Far...</h2>
			<p>It feels like my brain has been turned inside out! In a good way, <em>mostly</em>.
				I really enjoyed our back-end modules and am excited to tie everything together with our front-end lessons. 
				Also, my peers are super interesting people from all walks of life, so it's been really fun to work with them. 
			</p>

			<h2>Gaming</h2>
			<p>To unwind, I play games on my PC. Recently, I've been enjoying <strong>Bullets per Minute</strong> 
				and yet <em>another</em> playthrough of <strong>The Witcher 3</strong>.
